# Stolen Focus: Why you Can't Pay Attention and How to Think Deeply Again
__By: Johann Hari__
## Lessons Learned:
- A US study found that most office workers never get an hour of uninterrupted work. If this goes on for months and years, it scrambles your ability to figure out who you are and what you want. 
- There is so much information coming at us that we quickly run out of our personal attention resource
- There is no such thing as multitasking for people. Our brains only have a single processor. What we call multitasking is really just juggling tasks. So if you want to do well at something, focus on just doing that one thing. 
- Flow is a gold mine for focus. You need three things for flow: choose one single goal, make sure the goal is meaningful, and the tasks should push you to the edge of your capabilities.
- Since flow is something that brings a lot of joy into our lives, there should be several different sources of it in your life. Not only should work bring you into flow, but things outside of work should as well. This is why it is better to have a hobby outside of work than to just sit back and watch tv after work. If you don’t enter that flow state, you’ll wind up back on your phone looking for some kind of dopamine hit. 
- Sleep is not a passive processes, it is an active one. Your mind and body repairs itself and toxins are even flooded out of your brain during sleep. 
- The medium in which communication or media is engaged with, has a very significant impact on it. The way we interact and absorb information from TV, twitter, physical books, etc are all different. They impact the message as a whole. 
- In situations of low stress and safety, mind wandering will be a gift, a pleasure, a creative force. In situations of high stress or danger
- There are three crucial things that happen during mind wandering
	1. You are slowly making sense of the world. This is exactly what happens when you are reading a book, your brain is processing and thinking things through.
	2. Making new connections and connecting the dots. This is why you can come up with solutions to problems when allowing your brain to wonder.
	3. Your brain goes through a mental time travel. You reflect on the past and look into the future.
- Most people who design technology products do not allow their children to use them
- A negativity bias is active in our minds in that our attention goes to the negative. For example, your retweet rate will go up 20% for every word of moral outrage.
- An internal trigger is an uncomfortable emotional state. It is about avoidance. This often drives you to your phone or other easy/pleasurable thing when you are working on something stressful or difficult. We should explore them and find ways to disrupt these quick methods of avoidance. 
- To be able to focus and pay attention in normal ways, you need to feel safe. You can't focus if you are always on high alert for danger.
- People need time to rest and recover. This is why the 4-day work week has been so successful to companies and individuals who have adopted it. 
- What you eat has a significant impact on your attention. Eat whole foods and stick to the outside aisles of grocery stores. Fruits/veggies/meat.
- Animals, including people, need to live as nature intended. Horses and dogs need to run. Dogs need a pack and social life. Failure to do so results in anxious and odd behaviors. Many times this can lead to drugging animals to "calm them down".
- If a child is raised in an environment where there is a lot of stress and chaos, they are significantly more likely to develop attention problems.
	- Social support to the parents is the best way to decrease this chaos and stress.
- Children need to play and explore on their own. This is how they learn. They get to be creative and even learn how to interact with other children. They learn coping mechanisms while working with others. Making up their own games and policing themselves is part of growth.
- People find out what intrinsically motivates them by trying things on their own accord. 
- We all have a need for "mastery" that we are good at something.
	- This give us focus and the confidence to do more.
- Neale Donald Walsch: "Life begins at the edge of your comfort zone."
- Attention takes 3 forms:
	1. Spotlight, is when you focus on your immediate action.
	2. Starlight, focus to apply to long-term goals. When you feel lost you can look to the stars and find your way.
	3. Daylight, how you come up with your long term goals.
	    - 2 and 3 only come from sustained periods of reflection, mind wandering, and deep thought. 
- Instead of focusing on what you shouldn't do (cell phone distractions) think about what would put you into a flow state, think of it more as an opportunity
- Let your mind wander. Go for a walk or just space out for a bit.
