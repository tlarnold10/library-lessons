# Start: Punch Fear in the Face, Escape Average and Do Work That Matters
__By: Jon Acuff__
## Lessons Learned:
- every awesome life has gone through 5 stages.
	1. Learning - 20s 
	2. Editing - 30s
	3. Mastering - 40s
	4. Harvesting - 50s
	5. Guiding - 60s
- when you get to the finish line, you are going to look back and laugh at the idea that you could ever plot out your path and finish
- you don't really control the finish line and the path that you take. The only real thing you control is whether you start and when you do so
- being average is so popular because it is familiar. The path is well worn and you won't have too many surprises. Awesome is dangerous and you don't know what is going to be coming next. You might not know the next step until you have taken it. Awesome is an adventure!
- you have to realistic with where you are now and unrealistic about what the future could hold
- the worst thing you can do is to try and find your purpose in life. The reason is:
	- it puts a ton of pressure on you
	- it becomes an idol
	- you don't take those first steps until you find it
- instead of finding your purpose, think about living with a purpose. Very often, when you live with purpose, your life's purpose will find you. Another way to think about living with purpose is to live intentionally
- ways to go faster through the five stages from above
	- one: start earlier
	- two: learn from the masters
	- three: work harder and smarter (focus)
	- four: get lucky (big break)
- defeat the negative voices in your head by
	1. Writing down what the voice says so you can see how wrong it is
	2. Tell others about the negative voice. This allows you to hear how wrong the thoughts are as well as connecting with another person
- ask yourself " if I died today, what would I regret not being able to do? " and then "are those the things I spending time on right now? "
	- in a very similar vein, instead of asking yourself what you would love to start doing, ask yourself what you cannot stop doing. For example, I kept coming back to programming and finding ways to do things better
		- look at your big wins and successes, is there a common thread or practice that led to that success?
- everyone who has succeeded at something got there by learning through experiments
- the biggest question you need to ask yourself: " what bring you joy? "
- awesome doesn't care how big the audience is, if someone reads the book, or if you make a shit ton of cash, they provide the highest of qualify because that's just what they get excited about doing awesome on.
- If you are having a difficult time choosing between a couple different options, think ahead to the harvesting time in your life for each path and ask yourself which destination feels more like a success? Which feels awesome, not just okay
- there are going to be times where you have to fight to be awesome, you need to be scrappy
- secret to success in the harvesting phase is to not be a jerk
- don't underestimate the value you can provide as a reacher, even if you are fairly new to something
- share your success and failure stories. However, be sure to include what you learned from the failure
- need to write down a couple things:
	1. Fears when they come up. Identity them and call them out for what they are
	2. Audit what you think is average in your life. Physical, spiritual, financial, family, social, intellectual, and career
		1. Focus on just one of these parts of your life and make a single step to improve it today.
