# The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck
__By: Mark Manson__
## Lessons Learned: 
- A confident man doesn't feel a need to prove that he is confident
- The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it is giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important
- Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience for example, the pain in the gym makes you stronger and your business failures are what lead to a better understanding of what it takes to be successful
- Life is essentially an endless series of problems. The solution to one problem is just a creation of another one. Don't hope for a life without problems, hope for a life with good problems
- What pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for?
- When we feel that we're choosing our problems, we feel empowered. When we feel that our problems are being forced upon us against our will, we feel victimized and miserable.
- In the long run, completing a marathon makes us happier than eating a chocolate cake. Raising a child makes us happier than beating a video game. Starting a small business with friends while struggling to make ends meet makes us happier than buying a new computer. These activities are stressful, arduous, and often unpleasant. They also require withstanding problem after problem. Yet they are some of the most meaningful moments and joyous things we will ever do. They involve pain, struggle, and even anger and despair. Yet once they are accomplished, we look back and get all misty-eyed telling our grandkids about them. .
- Famous Michael Jordan quote about failing over and over again, that is why. he is successful. In a similar vein, being wrong over and over again is how life improves. Growth is an iterative process. Being wrong brings the opportunity to grow
- We can be truly successful only at something we are willing to fail at. If we are unwilling to fail, then we are unwilling to succeed. Life is about not knowing and doing something anyway.
- The mark on an unhealthy relationship is two people who try to solve each other's problems in order to feel good about themselves. If you make a sacrifice for someone you care about, it needs to be because you want to, not because you feel obligated or because you fear the consequences of not doing so. Same thing goes the other way around
