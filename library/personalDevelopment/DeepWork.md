# Deep Work
__By: Cal Newport__
## Lessons Learned: 
- great restructuring will have three different types of people who will thrive with the advances of artificial intelligence
	1. The owner- the guy with the money to invest
	2. High-skilled workers- those with skills that are difficult to obtain
	3. Superstars- with more remote workers available, and the technology to work remotely more effectively, companies can hire the best for what they need, not just focus on what is available locally to them
- core abilities for thriving in the new economy
	1. The ability to quickly  pick up hard things
	2. The ability to produce at an elite level. Both quality and quickly
- deep work is the type of work that optimizes your performance
- high quality work produced = time spent x intensity of focus
- learning requires intense concentration
- the fact that deep work is so rare is a great opportunity to those who can focus and really excel
- you don't need reply to an instant message or email right away. The world is not going to fall apart if you don't take that immediate action
- busyness as a proxy for productivity: in the absence of any indicators or feedback on what it means to be productive, many knowledge workers turn to doing lots of stuff in a visible manner
- people will often do email, instant message, or other shallow work because it is much easier than doing deep work. 
- strategies to achieve deep work
	1. Decide on your depth philosophy - your thought and general approach to deep work. Do you completely shut out shallow work, have dedicated time to deep work, etc.
	2. Create a routine that plans out  deep work
	3. Change up the scenery. Get out of your normal place of work for something different, but still allows you to completely focus
	4. Work with others. Collaboration can really improve your effectiveness, just make you you have a place for yourself 
	5. Completely step away from the work or challenge for a bit. This gives your conscious mind a rest while your unconscious mind can wrestle with the information. This is similar to coming up with a great idea or solution in the shower
		1. Attention restoration theory. Claims that spending time in nature can improve your ability to concentrate
		2. Have a ritual when finishing work for the day. Once that is done, completely leave work until the next day. Don't check email or any other shallow activities for the day. This allows your brain to fully recharge and be ready for the next day.
- Be okay with boredom. You don't need to reach for your phone at any point that y on feel bored.
	- schedule blocks of time to use the Internet or your phone
	- practice some intense focus from time to time, perhaps even once per day. You can do this by setting a very tight dead line for a task and sharing this deadline with others. You will have no other option to completing this task other than intense focus.
- productive meditation should be done 2-3 times per week. When you are doing something physically ( walking, running, showering, driving ) and focusing on a single professional problem..
- the craftsman approach to tool selection - adapt tools that only have a positive impact on the core factors that determine success and happiness in your venture.
- A person can only do about 4 hours of deep work per day
- implement a fixed schedule productive work day. This means that you set time to be done with work and bust your butt to be done by that time
