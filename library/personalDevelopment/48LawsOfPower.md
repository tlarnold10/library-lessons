# The 48 Laws of Power
__By: Robert Greene__
## Lessons Learned:
- law 1 - never outshine the master
	- always make those above you feel comfortably superior
	- never take your position for granted and never let accomplishments go to your head
	- instead of outshining your superiors, you should use discrete flattery. Don't make this flattery to obvious. Ask for their help and guidance.
- law 2 - never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies
	- if you have no enemies, make them
	- without enemies we can grow lazy. An enemy close at our heels keeps us focused and driven.
- law 3 - conceal your intentions
- law 4 - always say less than necessary
	- The more you say the more likely you are to say something foolish.
	- A person that cannot control their own words cannot control themselves.
- law 5 - so much depends on reputation, guard it with your life
	- make your reputation simple and base it on a single quality
	- if someone comes after your reputation, react calmly and confidently, or not at all.
- law 6 - court attention at all costs
	- do not get lost in the crowd, stand out.
	- being mysterious draws in a lot of attention. People are naturally drawn to something that is interesting and different
- law 7 - get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit
- law 8 - make other people comer to you, use bait if needed
	- control your aggression
	- make others react to you, rather than always reacting. A large part of this is being proactive.
- law 9 - win through your actions, never through argument
- law 10 - infection: avoid the unhappy and unlucky
	- surround yourself with people you look up to
- law 11 - learn to keep people dependent on you
	- power involves relationships with other people. You need allies, pawns, or ever a weak master who serves in front of you. Do not believe that independence is the ultimate power

- law 13 - when asking for help, appeal to people's self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude

- law 32 - play to people's fantasies
