# Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter
__By: Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson__
## Lessons Learned: 
- Success can be achieved only through repeated failure and introspection. Success represents 1 percent of your work, which results only from the 99 percent that is called failure.
- The only thing you can’t overcome is never taking risks in the first place.  The way to get past fear is to acknowledge it and come up with a plan to get past it.  There are two parts of fear: one you can get hit and you aren't going to die, and two you can always prepare to avoid getting hit all together.
- You’ve got to enjoy the grind and hard work
- Put together a vision board in order to identify what it is that you really want
- If you’re going to maintain control of your team, you must make people respect the repercussions. In order to get the best out of people sometimes you have to clearly and forcefully articulate the opportunities you see for them. Just because you see it for them, doesn't mean they see it. If someone is not responding to, or taking advantage of an opportunity you have created for them, you're going to have to take them to that place. That's what leadership means. You need to be able to articulate not only where you need that person to go, but also the steps they should follow to get there.
- You can control what people think of you. Things like clothes, cars, shoes, and watches can really change how people perceive you.
- Great competition makes everyone better. Doesn't have to revolve around hate, but can come from respect.
- If you can't be friends, the next best option is enemies. At least then you are still part of the conversation because people talk about what they really like and what they don't like
