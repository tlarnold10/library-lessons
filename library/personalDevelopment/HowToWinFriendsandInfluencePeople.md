# How to win friends and Influence People
__By: Dale Carnegie__
## Lessons Learned:
- Dale Carnegie claimed that all people can talk when they get mad. He said that if you hit the most ignorant man in town on the jaw and knock him down, he would get on his feet and talk with an eloquence, heat and emphasis that would have rivaled that world famous orator William Jennings Bryan at the height of his career. He claimed that almost any person can speak acceptably in public if he or she has self-confidence and an idea that is boiling and stewing within.
- The way to develop self-confidence, he said, is to do the thing you fear to do and get a record of successful experiences behind you.
- about 15 percent of one’s financial success is due to one’s technical knowledge and about 85 percent is due to skill in human engineering—to personality and the ability to lead people.
- Fundamental Techniques in Handling People
    - __Principle 1__: Don't criticize, condemn or complain
        - Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because    it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment. 
        - Let’s realize that the person we are going to correct and condemn will probably justify himself or herself, and condemn us in return; or, like    the gentle Taft, will say: “I don’t see how I could have done any differently from what I have.”
        - Do you know someone you would like to change and regulate and improve? Good! That is fine. I am all in favor of it. But why not begin on  yourself? From a purely selfish standpoint, that is a lot more profitable than trying to improve others—yes, and a lot less dangerous.
        - hen dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures  bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.
        - “To show you I’m sure that you’ll never do this again, I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow.”
        - Instead of condemning people, let’s try to understand them. Let’s try to figure out why they do what they do. That’s a lot more profitable and    intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness. “To know all is to forgive all.”
    - __Principle 2__: give honest and sincere appreciation
        - There is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything. Did you ever stop to think of that? Yes, just one way. And that is by  making the other person want to do it.
        - Dr. Dewey said that the deepest urge in human nature is “the desire to be important.”
        - If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I’ll tell you what you are. That determines your character. That is the most significant   thing about you.
        - “I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people,” said Schwab, “the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that    is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.” “There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors.     I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I  am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.”
        - showing sincere appreciation can change a person’s life.
        - The difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple. One is sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart out; the   other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish. One is universally admired; the other universally condemned.
        - One of the most neglected virtues of our daily existence is appreciation. Somehow, we neglect to praise our son or daughter when he or she    brings home a good report card, and we fail to encourage our children when they first succeed in baking a cake or building a birdhouse. Nothing    pleases children more than this kind of parental interest and approval.
        - I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me   not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.
    - __Principle 3__: Arouse in the other person an eager want
        - So the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.
        - you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask yourself: “How can I make this person want to do it?”
        - “If there is any one secret of success,” said Henry Ford, “it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from     that person’s angle as well as from your own.”
        - If out of reading this book you get just one thing—an increased tendency to think always in terms of other people’s point of view, and see    things from their angle—if you get that one thing out of this book, it may easily prove to be one of the building blocks of your career.
        - To repeat Professor Overstreet’s wise advice: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him.   He who cannot walks a lonely way.
        - William Winter once remarked that “self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.” Why can’t we adapt this same psychology to     business dealings? When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making others think it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves.    They will then regard it as their own; they will like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of it.
- Six Ways to Make People Like You
    - __Principle 1__: Become genuinely interestedin other people
        - you can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.
        - It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others.
        - If we want to make friends, let’s put ourselves out to do things for other people—things that require time, energy, unselfishness and thoughtfulness.
        - Publilius Syrus, remarked: “We are interested in others when they are interested in us.”
    - __Principle 2__: Smile
        - You don’t feel like smiling? Then what? Two things. First, force yourself to smile. If you are alone, force yourself to whistle or hum a tune or sing. Act as if you were already happy, and that will tend to make you happy. Here is the way the psychologist and philosopher William James put it: “Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.”
        - Your smile is a messenger of your good will. Your smile brightens the lives of all who see it.
    - __Principle 3__: Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language
        - Remember that name and call it easily, and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it—and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage.
        - We should be aware of the magic contained in a name and realize that this single item is wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing . . . and nobody else.
    - __Principle 4__: Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves
        - All she wanted was an interested listener, so she could expand her ego and tell about where she had been.
        - “There is no mystery about successful business intercourse. . . . Exclusive attention to the person who is speaking to you is very important. Nothing else is so flattering as that.”
        - Lincoln had done all the talking himself. That seemed to clarify his mind. “He seemed to feel easier after that talk,” the old friend said. Lincoln hadn’t wanted advice. He had wanted merely a friendly, sympathetic listener to whom he could unburden himself. That’s what we all want when we are in trouble. That is frequently all the irritated customer wants, and the dissatisfied employee or the hurt friend.
        - If you want to know how to make people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even despise you, here is the recipe: Never listen to anyone for long. Talk incessantly about yourself. If you have an idea while the other person is talking, don’t wait for him or her to finish: bust right in and interrupt in the middle of a sentence.
        - So if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments.
    - __Principle 5__: Talk in terms of the other person's interests
        - the royal road to a person’s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.
    - __Principle 6__: Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely
        - The law is this: Always make the other person feel important. John Dewey, as we have already noted, said that the desire to be important is the deepest urge in human nature; and William James said: “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.” As I have already pointed out, it is this urge that differentiates us from the animals. It is this urge that has been responsible for civilization itself.
        - Jesus summed it up in one thought—probably the most important rule in the world: “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.”
        - Little phrases such as “I’m sorry to trouble you,” “Would you be so kind as to ———?” “Won’t you please?” “Would you mind?” “Thank you”—little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday life
How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking
    - __Principle 1__: The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it
        - As wise old Ben Franklin used to say: If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent’s good will.
        - In an article in Bits and Pieces,* some suggestions are made on how to keep a disagreement from becoming an argument: 
            1. Welcome the disagreement. Remember the slogan, “When two partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.” If there is some point you haven’t thought about, be thankful if it is brought to your attention. Perhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to be corrected before you make a serious mistake. 
            2. Distrust your first instinctive impression. Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be careful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It may be you at your worst, not your best. 
            3. Control your temper. Remember, you can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her angry. 
            4. Listen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend or debate. This only raises barriers. Try to build bridges of understanding. Don’t build higher barriers of misunderstanding. 
            5. Look for areas of agreement. When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which you agree. 
            6. Be honest. Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness. 
            7. Promise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study them carefully. And mean it. Your opponents may be right. It is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their points than to move rapidly ahead and find yourself in a position where your opponents can say: “We tried to tell you, but you wouldn’t listen.” 
            8. Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you, and you may turn your opponents into friends. 
            9. Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem. Suggest that a new meeting be held later that day or the next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear.
    - __Principle 2__: Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, "You're wrong."
        - If you are going to prove anything, don’t let anybody know it. Do it so subtly, so adroitly, that no one will feel that you are doing it. This was expressed succinctly by Alexander Pope: Men must be taught as if you taught them not
    - __Principle 3__: If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.
    - __Principle 4__: Begin in a friendly way.
        - Lincoln said that, in effect, over a hundred years ago. Here are his words: It is an old and true maxim that “a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.” So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart; which, say what you will, is the great high road to reason.
    - __Principle 5__: Get the other person saying "yes, yes" immediately
        - In talking with people, don’t begin by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by emphasizing—and keep on emphasizing—the things on which you agree. Keep emphasizing, if possible, that you are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of purpose.
        - it doesn’t pay to argue, that it is much more profitable and much more interesting to look at things from the other person’s viewpoint and try to get that person saying ‘yes, yes.’”
    - __Principle 6__: Let the other person do a great deal of the talking
        - Most people trying to win others to their way of thinking do too much talking themselves. Let the other people talk themselves out.
    - __Principle 7__: Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers
        - isn’t it bad judgment to try to ram your opinions down the throats of other people? Isn’t it wiser to make suggestions—and let the other person think out the conclusion?
        - urged him to give me his ideas. This made him feel that he was creating the designs. And he was. I didn’t have to sell him. He bought.”
    - __Principle 8__: Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view
        - Remember that other people may be totally wrong. But they don’t think so. Don’t condemn them. Any fool can do that. Try to understand them. Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to do that. There is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does. Ferret out that reason—and you have the key to his actions, perhaps to his personality. Try honestly to put yourself in his place.
        - In his book Getting Through to People, Dr. Gerald S. Nirenberg commented: “Cooperativeness in conversation is achieved when you show that you consider the other person’s ideas and feelings as important as your own.
        - clear idea of what I was going to say and what that person—from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives—was likely to answer.”
    - __Principle 9__: Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires
        - Three-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.
    - __Principle 10__: Appeal to the nobler motives
        - J. Pierpont Morgan observed, in one of his analytical interludes, that a person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one. The person himself will think of the real reason. You don’t need to emphasize that. But all of us, being idealists at heart, like to think of motives that sound good. So, in order to change people, appeal to the nobler motives.
    - __Principle 11__: Dramatize your ideas
        - This is the day of dramatization. Merely stating a truth isn’t enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic. You have to use showmanship. The movies do it. Television does it. And you will have to do it if you want attention.
    - __Principle 12__: Throw down a challenge
        - Charles Schwab say it in his own words: “The way to get things done,” says Schwab, “is to stimulate competition. I do not mean in a sordid, money-getting way, but in the desire to excel.”
- Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment
    - __Principle 1__: Begin with praise and honest appreciation
    - __Principle 2__: Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly
        - feel encouraged until he heard the word “but.” He might then question the sincerity of the original praise. To him, the praise seemed only to be a contrived lead-in to a critical inference of failure. Credibility would be strained, and we probably would not achieve our objectives
        - changing the word “but” to “and.”
        - Really don't 
    - __Principle 3__: Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person
    - __Principle 4__: Ask questions instead of giving direct orders
        - Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable; it often stimulates the creativity of the persons whom you ask. People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused the order to be issued.
    - __Principle 5__: Let the other person save face
    - __Principle 6__: Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be "hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise."
        - Why don’t we use meat instead of a whip? Why don’t we use praise instead of condemnation? Let us praise even the slightest improvement. That inspires the other person to keep on improving.
        - The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of life.
    - __Principle 7__: Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to
        - if you want to improve a person in a certain respect, act as though that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding characteristics.
        - reputation to live up to—and that reputation had transformed her.
    - __Principle 8__: Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct
        - Tell your child, your spouse, or your employee that he or she is stupid or dumb at a certain thing, has no gift for it, and is doing it all wrong, and you have destroyed almost every incentive to try to improve. But use the opposite technique—be liberal with your encouragement, make the thing seem easy to do, let the other person know that you have faith in his ability to do it, that he has an undeveloped flair for it—and he will practice until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel.
    - __Principle 9__: Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest
        - Always make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.
        - The effective leader should keep the following guidelines in mind when it is necessary to change attittues or behavior:
            1. Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person. 
            2. Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do. 
            3. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what it is the other person really wants. 
            4. Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest. 
            5. Match those benefits to the other person’s wants. 
            6. When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit.
