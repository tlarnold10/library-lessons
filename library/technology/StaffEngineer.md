# Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track
__By: will Larson__

## Lessons learned:
- The four common archetypes of staff plus roles:
	1. Tech lead
	2. Architect
	3. Solver
		1. I could see myself liking this kind of staff engineer
	4. Right hand
- just like the Lorax speaks for the trees, a staff engineer speaks for the technology
- in order to be an effect technology leader, you need to avoid " Snacking is working on easy, low impact tasks that either don't need to be done at all or could be handed off to a more junior individual.
- what are some of  high impact things that you should work on?
	- existential issues that could result in business calapse
	- mentor and grow more junior team members
	- help finish things that might be stuck right before the finish line
		- unblocking activities of any kind are generally a good thing to look into
	- do the work that only you can do. Whether that is because of your technical knowledge or the bridges that you've developed throughout the organization
- good strategies guide trade offs and explain the rationale behind the decisions
	- to actually write a good strategy doc, review the last five design documents and consolidate all the common threads between them all.
- use five strategy docs to build a vision document, similar to what you did to develop a strategy using design documents
- before putting new processes into place to address quality concerns, see if there are any "hot spots" that solving a single item could drastically improve quality over all. When you do add new processes or best practices, add one at a time so you don't overwhelm the team and so you can review the impact of that single addition. The best source for research on best practices is Accelerate.
- decide on your specific metric for quality. This depends on several factors. The book gives some examples, but I wouldn't pick any one specific metric. There could be some kind of formula for quality?
- create a engineering team solely focused on engineering quality. They would work on things like developer tools and processes, as well as measuring and analyzing your quality metrics
- create a promotion packet and make sure to review it with your manager. This should include project examples on par with projects for the level you are aiming for. Determine who would be able to vouch for your capabilities. If you can, tie your work back to the business impact
- to get to the staff engineer level and be effective in the roles, you have to get into the room
	- to set into the room, you have to bring something valuable to the table that isn't already there.
- remember, when dealing with an offer to consider the factors outside of compensation. This includes flexibility, vacation days, and work schedule
- really try to focus in on what energizes you. What gets you excited and wanting to learn more?
- be aware of product debt, which is caused by supporting older versions of your product.
- think about including speaking at conferences as part of your career growth strategy
- you need to form good relationships with the people at the director and VP level, because they are the ones that can get you to the staff engineer level. Part of that is making your accomplishments known, and create a reputation for delivering value. 
- work on amplifying your strengths. Turn something that you are good at into your own superpower
