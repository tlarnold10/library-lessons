# The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide
__By: John Sonmez__
## Lessons Learned:
- you should know the answer to every single question in the top three results from Googling you technology choice + interview questions
- to learn by doing you have to have an immediate application for it - a reason to learn it (create a goal)
- the process of software development always begins by first understanding the problem to be solved. What are you automating?
- you have to know how to manually do something before you can automate it
- the idea behind most software projects is to automate a manual process, or to create a new automated way of doing something that was too difficult to do manually
- if you are interviewing for any object-oriented programming language, you better know what encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, data abstraction, interfaces, and abstract base classes are at the very least
- Know what the FizzBuzz problem is
- Think of your resume as an advertisement: keep it short and to the point, think about value you add, and keep in mind 1) what you did, 2) how you did it, and 3) what the impact was
- to master the language, solve complex algorithm challenges. you can use resources like (cracking the coding interview, programming pearls, project euler, codility, interview cake, topcoder)
- first step in learning a programming language is to read source code of an open source application
- Pareto principle: 20% of something produces 80% of the results
- when teaching, practice just in time (JIT) learning. give them what they need to know right off the bat and only teach them things they need to know at that specific time. for example, for a simple django website, you don't need to get into middleware, mention that it is there and you can come back to it later once they have a need to learn more about it
- teams tend to take on many of their leader's traits, especially over time
- In order to learn something quickly, you first have to
    1. get a good idea of what you are learning and what the scope of it is. 
    2. you need a goal. 
    3. create an actual plan for learning. 
    4. learn by doing. 
    5. finally, take what you learned and teach it to someone else
