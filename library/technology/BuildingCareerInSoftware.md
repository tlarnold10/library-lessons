__By: Daniel Heller__
## Lessons Learned:
- create alias for regularly used commands in the terminal. For example all the git commands like git status or git add
- when providing feedback to someone, point out the benefit to them if they take your recommendation
- people tend to copy the emotional characteristics of the leader. If the leader is angry, a bully or pessimistic, so will the team. The same if the leader is optimistic and helpful.
- professions like doctors and lawyers have a code of conduct and professionalism that could be a valuable add to software developers. Keep the standards for yourself high
- just like a woodworker, be proud of the work you do. Be a true craftsman
- top three skills that will keep you moving in software
	1. Coding
