# The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change
__By: Camille Fournier__
## Lessons Learned:
- Most people go through periods of uncertainty in their careers. This is normal and the cycle is allowed to be challenging. Expectations do not always line up well with reality, like managing people or life in a startup.
- If you find yourself resenting every manager you work for, you might be the problem. OR, you might be better off with no manager. 
- The tech lead may or may not manage people, it depends on the needs of the team. However, they are responsible for representing the group to management, vetting out plans for feature delivery, and dealing with project management. They should still be coding.
- Requires a change of focus from your own code to the effectiveness of the team
- Tech lead needs to understand the product architecture. They must be able to communicate well: write, read and speak in front of others
- Good first 1:1 questions can be found in a blog by Lara Hogan called First one on one questions. 
- Create a 30/60/90 plan for any new team members
- Keep a running list of notes from 1:1s. This should be shared with the individuals. Helps you keep track of past conversations and if there are any actions that need to be taken from a 1:1
- When things are not going super well ask the team how they are measuring their success and ask them to make that visible to you on an ongoing basis. If they cannot provide anything in a week or two, you probably need to be more clear on what success looks like. 
- Reviews should of course include a list of wins and misses over the past period. Bug you can also include something like a SWAT analysis. 
	- What are their strengths and weaknesses?
	- What are some opportunities for growth they see?
	- What are some upcoming challenges that will need to be addressed (threats)?
- If someone has hit a plateau in their role, which means they are doing okay in their current role but not to the level of a promotion, but they want to get to the next level, it is completely okay to suggest that maybe they try another team. However, if they are happy with where they are at, that is completely fine. There are people out there that are completely content in their senior dev position and staying there
- When managing a team, you should be kind, not nice. Kind can consist of giving strong feedback to someone because they need to hear it to improve and grow. It could potentially be letting someone go because they are not cut out for the position/role.
- Preparing for meetings and 1:1s would be considered important and not urgent. The same could be said about jotting some notes down after the meeting. There is a lot of value in coming to a meeting prepared and ready to go, as well as reflecting from the meeting.
- Laziness and impatience. We focus so we can go home, and we encourage going home because it forces us to constantly focus. This is how great teams scale.
	- Ask yourself how things can be automated or done easier/take less total time. 
- If your new manager (that you manage) skips your 1:1 or evades questions about what the team is working on, s/he might be a control freak.
- Management tends to be very culture-specific. What works really well at one company might not work at another
- You need to do reference checks when hiring for a manager role
- The difference between CTO and VP of engineering depends greatly on the organization and what it needs are
- Setting a tech strategy:
	1. Research the current state of things and identify the biggest org problems.
	2. Play around with the research data and information. What are some possible ideas that can be worked through?
	3. Draft action steps based on previous ideas
	4. Consider the communication and presentation method.
- As CTO, you really should socially detach from your team. Many issues can come from keeping a social relationship with people under you
- What you say and do will be echoed throughout the rest of your org.
- Employees who truly embrace and exhibit all the company core values tend to do well. They fit in well and are usually happy. Thos that do not match all core values will have a harder time. They may not fail, but will certainly feel more friction and they won't feel like they fit in.
- There are 2 things code review is for and 2 things they are not for
	- For:
		1. Reviewer to know what is happening
		2. Quick check on making sure the new code fits the architecture of the system and contains good coding practices.
	- Not for:
		1. Testing, which should be done by tests you have built
		2. Style, which should be taken care of during development by a linter
