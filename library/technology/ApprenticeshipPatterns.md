# Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman 
__By: David H. Hoover & Adewale Oshineye__
## Lessons Learned:
- Ask yourself "Never mind reality, what do you want to do with X?"
	- This allows you to think outside of the box and not hold back your ambitions. 
- In order to learn something new, we have to set aside our previous knowledge and experiences to fully embrace the new lessons. 
- Let people know if you don't know something and that you are learning it. This builds you up as a person that figures shit out. 
	- Ask lots of questions. Even if they seem obvious. 
- Growth happens when you take on the scary job that you are not completely ready for. You are forced to learn and stretch yourself. 
- Current career trajectory: smaller web applications, built using Angular, .NET, and Mongodb
	- Really want to use more React, python (django), and other database platforms as well. 
- Apprenticeship is a rollercoaster ride. One day you feel like you got this shit figured out, the next you feel like you are an idiot. This is normal. 
- Review questions on page 40!
	- Imagine what experiences you want to have had.
- There are going to be some really rough times, dumb projects, working with difficult people, or corporate BS. You will need to remember your why of programming in order to keep moving forward.
- Maintain an accurate job title for yourself, something that describes what you actually do rather than what the company has provided you. Compare it to what the organization has given you and make sure it tracks with where you want to be.
- Be the worst on the team. This will maximize your learning potential. You also cannot slack off nearly as easily as you always need to be pushing yourself to keep up. 
	- Seek out menial tasks in order to add value directly to the team if need be. 
	- This is a more risky strategy, but focuses heavily on the long term learning. 
- Example of how to find a mentor: look for an open source project that you use and the project is fairly active. In that open source project, find the people who are the best teachers and/or leaders. Those are the people you want to learn from on a regular basis.
- Create a "toy" application that you can play around with. This can be anything you want. you don't need to build anything new... Just build something you already use (calendar, to-do app, tic tac toe, wiki, blog, etc.). You can play around with new ideas in this toy box.
	- Added benefit of being able to easily test stack overflow questions and solutions.
	- It would be awesome to have a toy for each language to play with.  
- Share what you learn. 
	- Even if you are still new, other newbies will appreciate learning from another newbie. You are closer to the problem than an expert.
	- Solidifies your own learning and ensures that you really know your shit. 
	- Provide information to others that you wish you had when you started out. 
- Think about when you read a book as much as what books you will be reading. Some books, like Design Patterns, are more challenging to understand without an existing knowledge base.
