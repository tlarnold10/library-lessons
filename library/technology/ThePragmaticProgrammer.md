# The Pragmatic Programmer
__By: Andrew Hunt__
## Lessons Learned:
- Prototypes could will probably never be used in the production copy. A wood and tape version of a car is good for a prototype, but you wouldn't want to drive it down a highway
- Write code that you can be proud of. Someone can see your name on it, someone should expect it to be solid, well written, test, and documented. Artists sign their works of art because they are proud of what they have created, you should be proud of your code as well.
- Help set expectations and communicate what they are and the likelihood of those expectations would not be met.
- Comments should discuss why something is done, it’s purpose and goal. The code will tell you how it is done.
- Some things are better done than described
- Use a project glossary: I list of terms and other ideas to keep track of between everyone involved. Use standard language
- Refactoring is important, clean things up. An example is surgery, either you take out a small problem now or it continues to grow and becomes a much larger problem in the future
- Programming is more like gardening than construction
- Show them a glimpse of the future and you’ll get them to rally around
- Take responsibility by thinking through a conversation of what can’t be done. Think through the follow up questions. Provide alternatives instead of just problems
