# Learning React: Functional Web Development
__By: Alex Banks__
## Lessons Learned:
- Props are the child of any thing, like the text in an <h1> tag. Props to not change
- `.map` function iterated over an array and does something to it
- Components are just a pieces of the web application
- 3 different ways to setup components: createClass, ES6 classes, and stateless functional components. Usually use the ES6 method
- Need to use the bind function when working with ES6 and state
- As the user interacts with the application, things change, which is where state comes in. Unlike props, state can change.
