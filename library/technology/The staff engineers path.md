# The Staff Engineers Path
__By: Tanya Reily__

## Lessons learned:
- the three pillars of staff engineering
	1. Big picture thinking
	2. Execution (getting things done )
	3. Building up people around you
- technical knowledge and experience is the foundation to staff engineering
- want to know what topics or disciplines you gravitate lo? Talk with a friend and ask them to watch your emotional responses and energy levels. They will likely be able to identify what you get really excited about vs what you don't seen to enjoy
- look for projects or problems that need your special blend of knowledge, experience, and perspective. Delegate to others who are capable of doing certain thing so you can focus on what is important specifically for you.
- culture sliders:
	1. Secret vs open
	2. Oral vs written
	3. top down vs bottom up
	4. Fast vs deliberate
	5. Back channel vs front doors
	6. Allocated vs available
	7. Liquid vs crystallized
- think about where you want to work in regards to these culture sliders
- creating a vision
	1. Description of high-level values and goals
	2. Decision making principles
	3. Decisions already agreed upon
	4. Architecture diagram
- when creating a strategy and vision, work with a core group
- use "even over" statements when evaluating trade-offs. For example. We value test coverage even over sprint through put
- think of work as a combination of effort and impact. You can do some low effort and low impact work from time to time, called snacking. But don't spend too much time on this sort of work
- five things to do at the start of the project to feel a little lessoverwhelmed
	1. Create a note sheet for your ideas that you can reference through out the project. This is just for you
	2. Meet with the project sponsor to ensure you are understanding of the project goals and expectations
		1. You should also identify key metrics that can be used to determine the success of the project 
	3. Think about who is going to be your sounding board when things get tough
	4. Get some kind of easy/ quick win under your belt. A diagram would de a good example
	5. Learn as much as you can utilizing the way that you learn best. This could be talking with people, reading code, reviewing documentation, drawing diagrams, etc.
- A common form of project documentation is called a request for comment RFC
- what is in a request for comment
	- context of the project or decision that needs to be made
	- project goals
	- proposed solution design. Include as much of the current solution as you have
	- security and/or any compliance
	- alternatives
	- optional: trade-offs, risks, known dependencies like other teams, operations like hosting and deployments
- At this stage, coding is likely not the best way to leverage your time. Having said that, the amount of code you write will vary significantly based on the project, team, organization, and your own skill and preferences
- when working with other teams, make sure you are building bridges and relationships. This can make a huge difference when they are a bottleneck on your project
- a good email strategy is explaining the situation in no more than 3 bullet points and then a call to action
- A company might have written down values, but the real values are what get people promoted
	- as a leader, you shape the company and culture just by how you behave
- four attributes to leadership:
	1. Being competent
	2. Being a responsible adult
	3. Remembering the goal
	4. Looking ahead
- avoid over your ass engineering. Take ownership and find the authority to make decisions. Radiate intent, which means you communicate out what actions you intend to perform
- if there is a situation in a meeting where everyone should take a minute to reflect or think,  say you need to catch up with the meeting notes to help control the flow of the meeting
	- if you are the one actually taking the meeting notes, you allow even, one else to be engaged and you can frame any decisions or takeaways your way. Another positive of taking the meeting notes yourself is that you set the pace for the meeting
- know your users super well and know how they will be using your product. Don't create things for the "ideal" user
- the metric for success is whether other people want to work with you. Be the engineer that everyone wants to work with! .
- there are three different tiers of influence
	1. Individual
	2. Group
	3. Catalyst, like creating an onboarding program that others use to onboard
- four mechanisms to level up your colleagues
	1. Advice
	2. Teaching
	3. Providing guardrails
	4. Providing opportunities
- giving talks or presentations and writing documentation are some of the best ways to scale up your influence and advice
- every teaching engagement should have a goal or objective
- when looking for or providing feed back on a specific design, document, or code, make sure you understand the assignment. This means you need to know if the feedback needs to be high level, like you are or are not on the right path, or very detailed, like you used the wrong variable name here.
- when building your career, remember to forms on the job aspects most important to you. Whether that is money, flexibility, learning, impact, or something completely different
- five metrics to your current job health
	1. Are you are learning
	2. Are you investing in transferable skills
	3. Would you recruit other people to your team
	4. Are you confident in your work
	5. Are you stressed with your work
- careers come in two phases: one, learning what your strengths are and two, finding the right role for those strengths
