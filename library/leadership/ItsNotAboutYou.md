# It's Not About You
__By: Tom Rath__
## Lessons Learned: 
- Instead of asking what your passions are, think about what the world around you needs today
- The key to creating collective well being is to start by improving the life of another person, not your own
- Our life is shaped by the actions of others, for better or for worse. Think about how you affect the lives of others and how it shapes their lives
- You always have a choice of how to respond. Start by assuming the other person has positive intent
- One of the most valuable things you can do today is spend just fifteen minutes listening to another person
- The iPhone effect: a conversation can easily be changed just due to the presence of a phone. Therefore, when having a conversation or even during a meal, leave your phone in your pocket or somewhere else, but do not set it out on the table
- When you see a rare opportunity, take it. Life is too brief for living with regrets
- Tell someone how they have contributed to your life, while they are still around to hear it. This something you want to do every Sunday?
