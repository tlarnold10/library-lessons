# The Dichotomy of Leadership: Balancing the Challenges of Extreme Ownership to Lead and Win
__By: Jocko Willink__
## Lessons Learned:
- The first dichotomy of leadership is that you have to care about the people you lead, but you also need to put the mission first, which might involve risks to the individuals. For example, don’t get so attached that you cannot remove someone from the team if it is going to keep the entire team from getting he job done. Don’t risk the livelihood of the entire team because of a single or few individuals 
- If people aren’t performing, you can threaten them with micromanagement 
- When people become accustomed to being told what to do, they will wait around until someone tells them what to do. Initiative fades and will eventually die
- Understand when you should strongly enforce rules and when you should just let something go. You can't be too lenient, but don't become overbearing
- Leadership capital is similar to the concept of knowing how to pick your battles
- You need to know when to let someone go. They could be creating a risk for the entire team and the mission. Time with a poor performer is time away from the rest of the team, it is also a drain on team moral to see the other person being carried constantly. Fire someone when you have exhausted all options to coach them and given several warnings that performance needs to improve
- Rather than passively waiting to be told what to do, Default: Aggressive leaders proactively seek out ways to further the strategic mission. They need to understand the mission and execute accordingly. If they don't have the authority to make a decision in the moment, they make recommendations up the chain of command. Aggressive means proactive, not angry.
- Build training into some kind of reoccuring event. Maybe something like role playing certain situations.
- Have standard operating procedures (processes), but you have to be flexible and make sure you are focused on the mission. 
- Hold people accountable, but do not hold their hands. Make sure that they fully understand the why. 
The weakest form of leadership is winning an arguement because of rank. 
- A leader must be willing to lean on the expertise and ideas of others. 
- The relationship with any boss should include:
    1. They trust you
    2. They value and seek your opinion and guidance.
    3. They give you what you need to accomplish your mission and then let you go execute. 
- Choose at most 3-4 most probable contingencies for each phase, along with the worst case scenario. 
- Fight against complacency and overconfidence. 
- Make sure you see and understand the bigger picture. 
- Humility is the most important quality in a leader.
- Check your ego, accept constructive criticism, take ownership of your mistakes. 
- The opposite can also be harmful, don't be too passive. You need to push back, voice concerns, stand up for the good of the team and provide feedback up the chain of commmand. 
- Be careful were you decide to push back against leadership. If you push back against everything, concerns won't be taken seriously. 
- You need to stay above the details to see the bigger picture, but you also need to dig in from time to time to experience what the team experiences.
