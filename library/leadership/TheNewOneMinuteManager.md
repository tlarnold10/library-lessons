# The New One Minute Manager
__By: Ken Blanchard__
## Lessons Learned:
- Performance reviews should be an ongoing thing. Not something that just happens yearly. When you see something being done incorrectly, call it out
- People want to know how they are doing. They need to know what their. People need to know what they are aiming at and how to tell if they are doing a good job
- Re-direct people as soon as possible. Re-direct has 2 parts:
    1. Confirm the facts and review the mistakes together with specifics. Express how you feel about the mistake and it’s impact on results. 
    2. Remember to let them know that they are better than their mistake and that you think we’ll of them as a member of the team
- You can use silence as an opportunity for someone to reflect. You can use this either when giving praise or when someone messes up
- Praise someone as soon as possible, be specific, tell people how good you feel and how it helps
- Help people reach their full potential, catch them doing something right
- Our manager works with us to make it clear what our responsibilities are and what we are being held accountable for
- The most effective managers manage themselves and the people the work with so that both the people and the organization profit from their presence.
- Catch someone doing something approximately right in the beginning. Then you move on toward the desired result
- Tell people what they did wrong, tell them how you feel about it, and remind them that they are better than that. Their performance is bad, but they are good
