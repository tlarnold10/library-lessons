# Master of One
__By: Jordan Raynor__
## Lessons Learned:
- Once you start down the path of experimentation, do the following: examine the fruits of our experiments, seek feedback from others and observe what the Lord is doing and where he is leading.
- Place small bets on these experiments and fail fast
- Three keys to mastery: learn from other masters through apprenticeships (directly or indirectly), purposeful practice, and discipline over time
- It is through the ministry of excellence that we best love our neighbors through our work. When you go the extra mile you are treating others the way you would like to be treated
- Questions to ask in the process of choosing your one vocational thing: What am I passionate about? What gifts has God given me? Where do I have the best opportunity to glorify God and serve others?
- Lots of good questions to think about on page 83 to think about what your options are and what you can experiment with
- We feel God’s pleasure when we know we are doing the work he created us to do
- Four elements of purposeful practice: specific goals, intense focus, rapid feedback, and frequent discomfort
- We do not need more people writing Christian books. What we need is more Christians writing good books
- One of the greatest promises of mastery is that when we do our work exceptionally well, focusing first and foremost in serving others rather than pushing a particular agenda, we win the respect of the world and earn the right for our message to be heard
- As you work your way towards mastery, power will come to you. Do no use this for selfish reasons, but rather as an opportunity to better serve others
- We get to love what we do by getting really good at it
- When we focus on doing masterful work primarily for God’s glory and the good of our neighbor, we bring joy to our Master, who graciously invites us to share in that happiness with him

- Masterful work requires tremendous focus
- How do we bring God glory? We reflect his greatness and character to the world
- The list of things you say yes to should be short, because each item takes an extraordinary amount of time and energy to pursue with excellence
- If we are unwilling to say no to the nonessential in order to focus on the work we feel called to master, we are selfishly holding back the contribution God has called us to make in this world
- There is no right or wrong decision. There is only a best decision. Certain paths could have many different pivot points based on where God leads you
- If after your experimentation it is clear that you have yet to find your one thing, it is likely time to pivot
