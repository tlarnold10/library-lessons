# Talking with God
__By: Adam Weber__
## Lessons Learned:
- When you feel inadequate, that is when God can use you
- Here I am, Lord
- Jesus is our anchor and is the thing we can cling to when things get rough. Pray for him to hold on to us during difficult times
- When you feel that restlessness, anxiety, and longing for something, that is when you need God in your life!
- Ask God to drive your life
- Pray all day, find those little moments to pray while you are doing other things
- Need to listen to God by being quiet
- God is just excited that you are coming to him and wants to celebrate that
- Talk with God like you would someone you are extremely close with
- Be honest and simpleÂ when praying
- It is about having a relationship with God and talking deeply with him
- Pray for God to lead your life
- Being dead inside is filled with anger and other bad things, because of Jesus, you are alive
- God wants to talk and be with the real you
- Reading the Bible helps you know what god sounds like, so that you will know when he is talking with you
- Know God by talking with him often
- Pray to give grace to people who have caused you some kind of pain. Another thought is that grace is unearned forgiveness and compassion
