# God is my CEO
By: *Larry Julian*
## Lessons learned:
- your challenges and dilemmas strengthen you to become the leader that God has called you to be.
- you become what you believe and do every day
- need to work on these
	1. Development of your God given talents and skills
	2. Internal development of spiritual core. Aka your relationship with God
- never let your brain coast. Don't mentally retire and proceed to go into auto pilot.
- take a leap of faith for your dreams. Choose to believe that God speaks to you and will support you. God has something in store for us and it is up to us to find out what that is.
- life is short, so make the right priorities for today! Make the most of your time, and do it with a sense of urgency.
- define success, impact, legacy, and significance for yourself
- if today was your last day, would you be proud of it?
- instead of waiting for God to "speak" to you, try saying to God: "I am going to do this thing unless you stop me."
- proverbs 16:3 "commit to the lord whatever you do and your plans will succeed"
- we don't use God for our success, he uses our talents for his purpose
- blend accountability and compassion in business
- think about what kind of manager you would want and take that into account in your management approach
- keep things in perspective and remember what is really important in your current season of life.
- think about what the root cause of your burnout is. Is it something you can delegate. Or something that is only a short term problem? Or do you need to get away for a short period of time?
- what is in your hands that God has given you? Resources? Abilities? Circumstances?
- focus on what is happening right now around you. God has put you in this specific situation to learn something. Don't miss out because you were too focused on the past or future
- Calling doesnâ€™t mean we are what we do. Calling means we do what we are. What are your unique gifts, resources, and spheres of influence?
