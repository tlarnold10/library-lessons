# Tough My Journey to True Power
__By: Terry Crews__
## Lessons Learned:
- People want their feelings validated, that's it. They want to be heard
- You carrot control and love people at the same time
- The purpose of being tough is to protect, not attack. Purpose of being strong is to support, not dominate. The purpose of power is to support, not rule. True men serve others
- Very often the people that have to be the best are trying to get away from something. So in order to hide or make up for something, they work super hard on something else. 
- Addiction usually comes around from HALT (hungry, angry, lonely, tired). Need to find what triggers that addiction 
- Need to live a virtuous life, not just to avoid punishment or work towards awards, but because it is what’s best for you. This is true in parenting as well, look to understand your kids and be understanding. Shouldn’t use the award or punishment approach
- Let go of the shame, because it will bottle up and explode onto other people as bursts of anger
- You can’t control when luck will come your way, good or bad luck. But it comes only if you put in the work. It comes as the fruit of your effort.
- Use every experience as a learning experience 
- Be energetic 
- Tithe. Give away 10% 
- You make based on the value you provide others. Want to make more? Become more valuable to others
- Self control over anger and how you respond is power.
