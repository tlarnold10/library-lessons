# It's Good to be Gronk
By: __Rob Gronkowski__

## Lessons Learned:
- know what your top priority is and make sure nothing else is worked on until you take care of the work that hits that top priority. Work before play
- you've got to have fun doing that thing you want to be the best at
- have fun during the process. When it is time to get after it and work hard, do it. But between sets and off time, have some fun. Enjoy the process
