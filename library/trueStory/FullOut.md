__By: Monica Aldama__
## Lessons Learned:
- Compassionate discipline is where people feel free to make good choices. People need structured discipline and compassion
- you can be very direct with one person, but that same comment would hurt someone else’s feelings and lower their confidence. And once you kill their confidence, they aren’t going to be able to perform at their best. 
- If one person is late, the entire team has to run laps. Makes that person understand the consequences of their actions and builds up the team importance 
- Take ownership when you’ve done wrong, make it right, and try to do better
- Speak in a calm, self controlled way, even when you are trying to correct a certain behavior. You should rarely lose your temper. If you have to on some rare occasions, people will know something is really needing to be fixed
- Marriage advice: don’t keep score, communicate feelings, be comfortable just hanging out
- I don’t want to hear any doubts or negativity 
- Give yourself fully to the task at hand. Stay focused and committed to your single passion. Fully throw yourself at it
- Make sure the team understands that your goals are really their goals
- Having little inside jokes or rituals that are specific to your team can be extremely effective at brining the team closer together
- People need to feel that you care for them in order to give you their best. Then you need to set high expectations
- When you don't have goals, you can get lost.
