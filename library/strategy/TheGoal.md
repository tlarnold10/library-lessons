# The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement
__By: Eliyahu M. Goldratt__
## Lessons Learned:
- Ultimate goal of a company is making money. Is measured by net profit, ROI, and cash flow
- Measurements that lead to making money are throughput (the rate at which the system generates money through sales), inventory (all the money the system has invested in purchasing things which it intends to sell), and operational expense (all the money the system spends in order to turn inventory into throughput)
- Don’t give people the answers, but instead, ask them questions that will lead them to the answers
- Know the core problem
- Five focusing steps:
    1. Identify the system’s constraint or bottleneck. 
    2. Decide how to exploit the constraint. 
    3. Subordinate everything else to the above decision. 
    4. Elevate the system’s constraint. 
    5. If in the previous steps a constraint has been broken, go back to step 1, but do not allow inertia to cause a system constraint
