# Successful Consulting Practice
__By: Bruce L. Katcher__
## Lessons Learned:
- Find a niche market that you can be an expert on.
- It is going to be difficult to do this and often times it will be lonely. If this is really what you want to do you have to set the right expectations. If you don't actually want to do this, that is completely alright.
- From the math in this book, work backwards from how much money you want to earn and then figure out how much you have to sell. Also take into account what your business model is and how much you can sell your service for.
- There are a lot of different ways to do marketing and sales. Pick one that you enjoy and ensure that you schedule that activity weekly to maintain a stream of clients.
