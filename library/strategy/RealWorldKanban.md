# Real-World Kanban: Do Less, Accomplish More with Lean Thinking
__By: Mattias Skarin__
## Lessons Learned:
- Visualize workflow, limit work in progress, manage flow, make process policies explicit, implement feedback loops, and improve collaboration, evolve experimentally
- Two main measurements are throughput and lead time
- Change should never come as a surprise
- Focus on the whole, not just the parts. If you focus just on the parts, you might miss something like rework. Rework, often due to poor quality, hides between functions and is often invisible to people in the value stream
- Running small experiments is key to success. You can make decisions quicker and then reflect on the outcome of those experiments to determine the best path forward.
- Trust the people closest to the problems
- Sprint vs kanban… kanban focuses on the flow of work, largely driven by quality. Sprints are date driven while kanban is quality driven
- Collaborative design is when a challenge or idea is brought to the development teams to determine what the best solution to a problem or approach would be best. The person generating the idea or problem should be present.
- Standup should be for addressing roadblocks and making decisions, not a status update
- Lead time is the important metric. How long is something inside the entire process. 
- Give people estimates based on the 95%. This is also known as the upper control limit. Don’t use the average because this would mean 50% of the time you will be delivering late
- Visualize the value stream. Run small experiments. 
- Change management team is focused on releases and production updates
- Have 1 person a week responsible for supporting the rest of the team and answering questions. If that person doesn't know how to answer a question, it is their responsibility to learn it. They are also responsible for maintaining an FAQ for the rest of the team to use
- Need to limit work in progress. Make sure there is a clear indication of progress that the entire team can see. Burn down is an option
- T-shirt sizing for estimates. Small meant a day or less, medium meant a week or less, and large meant anything over 1 week
- The First step in good leadership is to clarify the common goal. The second thing to do in good leadership is to follow up with vigilance on improvement actions taken. Nothing derails trust and breeds resentment more than people not pulling their weight. Visualizing the improvement action and asking participants to report their progress in front of everyone makes  them accountable. This is a good way to follow up on improvement actions taken.
- There is no better way to fix problems than to have the developer on the spot, sitting next to the user.
- There are certain questions that need to be answered before a new feature goes to the development team. One. What is the products impact? What gets better in the customers world when he or she uses the product? Two. What are the product trade-offs you’re willing to make and what must you stand your ground on? Three. How can you as a stakeholder arrive prepared for a conversation with the development team?
