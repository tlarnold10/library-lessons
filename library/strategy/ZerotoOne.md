# Zero to One
__By: Peter Thiel__
## Lessons Learned:
- The strange people that found companies can many times be the best people to make great leaps forward in innovation.
- Questions every business must answer; can you create breakthrough tech or just incremental improvements? Is now the right time? Are you starting a big share of a small market? Do you have  the right team? Do you have a way to deliver your product? Will your market position be around in 10-20 years? Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?
- The goal of technology is not to replace people, but rather to help people do their current jobs better. Computers are components to people not substitutes. Ask how can computers help humans solve hard problems
- Each person should do one thing. This minimizes conflict amongst the team and also makes sure that each person knows what their swim lane is.
- You should like the people you work with. These are people you are going to be spending a lot of time with, do not under value the relationships that you have with your coworkers. If you can't count durable relationships among the fruits of your time at work, you haven't invested your time well.
- Cash is attractive, but it teaches to value the company as it already is, and not how it could be. Cash is more about the present than the future. Which short term thinking, equity is long term thinking that can get people more interested in the future.
- When starting something, the most crucial decision is who you start it with. Think of it like a marriage founders should share a history together.it is very difficult to go from O to l by yourself
- You should focus relentlessly on something you are good at, but make sure it is going to be valuable in the future.
- Matthew 25:29: for whoever has will be given more, and they will have abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
- Jobs saw that you can change the world through careful planning, not by listening to focus groups feed back or copying others success. Long-term planning is often undervalued by our short-term world.
- Start small and monopolize. The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors
- Characteristics of a monopoly: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding
- Successful companies will generate profits in the future, long term
