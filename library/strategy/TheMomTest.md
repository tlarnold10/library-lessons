# The Mom Test
__By: Rob Fitzpatrick__
## Lessons Learned:
- during early customer conversations, the measure of usefulness of the conversation is whether we get facts about the customer's lives and world views.
- avoid talking about your idea initially.
- the mom test:
	- talk about their life instead of your idea
	- ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions of the future
	- talk less and listen more
- if someone hasn't already looked for a way to solve their problem, they won't be searching for your solution.
- the customer owns the problem, you own the solution. They likely won't know about how to solve it... So ask questions to learn more about the problem
- there are three types of bad data when talking with customer:
	- compliment
		- very difficult to ignore because it feels good to be validated
	- fluff, such as generics, hypotheticals, and the future
	- ideas
- stay away from bad data and focus on facts and commitments
- when you hear a request you need to understand the motivation, or root cause, behind that request
- really dig into emotions, understand why they feel a certain way
- if you slip info pitch mode, just apologize and say you just get excited about solving the problem
- you need to ask questions that could completely alter your entire business.at least one that has the potential to sink your product. You should be terrified of this question, but it needs to be asked -
- keeping things casual is important. If it feels like they are doing you a favor, it is probably too formal
- a bad meeting is one in which no commitment or advancement have been a agreed upon
- you don't have to mention that you are building something. Just ask them questions about their work and some of the things they don't like
- write a blog on the industry or organize some kind of event in the industry to start learning more about
- don't go into initial conversations looking for a customer, instead, be on the lookout for an industry advisor.
- initial email format: vision, framing, weakness, pedestal, and ask. State you are an entrepreneur looking to better understand the problem and this is not a sales pitch.
- keep having these conversations until you stop hearing new things.
- select a very small customer segment that is most likely to actually buy. Don't try to be everything to everybody
- come up with 3 big learning goals for your conversations with customers
